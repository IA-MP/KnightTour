# KnightTour
Algorithms and Data Structure Course at Univeristy of Rome Tor Vergata - AA 2013/2014

## Quick overview
This is a simple study-case of the KnightTour problem on chessboard of possibly infinite rows and random generated cols and not finite k-knights (k is the number of the possible moves per turn). 

## Graph Theory
To solve the problem every chessboard has been stored into the machine as a graph of all the possible knight tours of all the knights. Then the graph is analyzed using implementations of the Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, BFS and DFS visits.
